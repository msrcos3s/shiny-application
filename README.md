# Real-time ICU beds occupancy rate in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil

## Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This ShinyApp presentation is part of the course Developing Data Products of the Coursera Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University.

## Instructions:

-  Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
- Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
- Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
- Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

This application automatically connects to the [SEADE](https://github.com/seade-R/dados-covid-sp/blob/master/data/plano_sp_leitos_internacoes.csv) foundation public database and shows the evolution of the occupancy rate of ICU beds in real time.

This prototype is a demonstration of what can be done with all public epidemiological databases in Brazil.

## How to use the application 

The application is running on 

<https://msrcos3s.shinyapps.io/ICU_SP/>

1. As the database is large, please, wait a few seconds for the graphing function to load.
2. With the application running, select the region of interest to view the evolution of ICU occupancy over time.
3. The graph is interactive and automatically adjusts to the size of your screen, so you can zoom in to see more details.

A Rpresentation is also hosted on RPubs:

If you have any suggestions, please fell free to commit here in GitHub.

Thank you!
